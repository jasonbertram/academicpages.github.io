Welcome! I am a theoretical biologist working broadly in the areas of evolution and ecology. I develop mathematical models to gain insight into how ecological communities are structured, and how populations adapt to their ecological circumstances.

Short bio
------

I was originally trained in mathematics at the University of Cape Town (South Africa), and then completed my graduate studies in theoretical ecology in the Research School of Biology at the Australian National University. Following graduate school, I expanded my research program to encompass evolutionary questions during a postdoc in the Masel lab in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Arizona. I am currently an independent research fellow in the Environmental Resilience Institute at Indiana University, where I study the genetics/genomics and eco-evolutionary dynamics of evolving populations in the lab and in the wild.
