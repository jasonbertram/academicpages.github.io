Welcome! I am a theoretical biologist working broadly in the areas of evolution and ecology. I develop mathematical models to gain insight into how ecological communities are structured, and how populations adapt to their ecological circumstances. 

Short bio
------

Originally trained in mathematics, my research career started in the physics of plasmas and turbulent fluids, but I soon switched to join the exciting developments occuring in the life sciences. In my PhD, I worked on extending statistical physics to community structure questions in ecology. Through this work I became more familiar with a diverse body of unsolved problems in population biology, and I have since developed a strong interest in the theory of evolution and population genetics (the study of how the genetic composition of populations changes over time). On thing I love about population genetics is its  potential for developing rigorous and empirically tested quantitative theories of evolution due to the explosive growth of DNA sequence data. The problems I work on now are a blend of population genetics and ecology, and have important applications in the medical and environmental sciences.
